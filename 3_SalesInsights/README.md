This Power BI project, "Revenue Insights in Hospitality Domain", focuses on exploring and analyzing the revenue metrics of a hotel chain. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders gain actionable insights into various KPIs such as Occupancy Rate, ADR (Average Daily Rate), RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), and overall booking trends.
The project utilizes dimensional data modeling (star schema) principles, loading multiple fact and dimension tables to create a rich, interactive dashboard aimed at driving better business decisions.
